## Programming and Databases Mid term project

This is the project for the programming and databases course @ Univr for the Data Science Master's Degree. The dataset I've chosen is the European Soccer Database which is available for free on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer). On this project I've done some basic explain data analysis, data cleaning, search for some patterns and a lot more. If you want to use the project just install the requirements using the command 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The application is entirely written in Python 3.9.6 and it uses the streamlit package to deliver a web interface on which you can interact. The first time you are opening the application you have to download the database which is done by the application, you just need to save the database in the project Path where the main.py file is located and then you are free to go.
